# Alterniabound-GMS
A conversion of the Javascript Alterniabound engine from WhatPumpkin to GameMakerLanguage.

And that was the short version, the long version of what MadCreativity (https://github.com/aam051102) and I are doing is taking the source from WhatPumkin's original Javascript based Alterniabound Engine which can be found here: https://github.com/WhatPumpkin/Sburb-Legacy. 

We're trying to make it so everything you can do in the original project you can do here, and hopefully more.

# How to install/run
To install all you have to do is open the project in GameMaker, then you can work with it all you want. There will be comments inside the objects (written by Mad) if you need help. 

Running is also extremely simple, all you have to do is press the run button! And the engine can also be used for making HTML files as well if you still want to do that.
